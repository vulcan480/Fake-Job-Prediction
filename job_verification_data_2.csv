PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE! If you are working in the merchant cash advance/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully. Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation. Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make. What a disaster that would be. Wouldn't you agree? But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal. We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry. We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country. The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify. Your manager's agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals. Gross profit for our Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions. Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company. An Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders. Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place). If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit. On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60/40. So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager. Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month. Even on the subprime deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal. So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%, Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees. On a 50K subprime deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager. Your manager’s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps. Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left. This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days. We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid,  We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail. We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way. We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A. Recruit Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B. Train Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C. Manage Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company) If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business. If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins. This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person. If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad. If you are a rep sitting in someone else's business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply. We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area. But you may recruit offline wherever you want. So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back.

14869,"Application Software Engineer","US, SD, Sioux Falls","Engineering","","Working at FBNAt FBN, we put farmers first. For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small. Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.","￼FBN's primary mission is to provide farmers with an unbiased and independent platform for agricultural analytics, using proprietary models based on ground truth data, satellite imagery, weather models, and the combined experience of our network of farmers. We aim to be a place where farmers can get credible insights on what equipment, seeds and practices would work best on their farm.We're looking for a mission driven software engineer to help drive several critical aspects of our backend technology as well as transform farm equipment controller data into useful information used by growers.","ResponsibilitiesOnce you join our team, you will be expected to:Prototype and develop backend services supporting FBN's growers.Work with R&amp;D in providing tools for processing large volumes of GIS data.Support our farmers in providing our operations team the best possible agronomic data.Required SkillsYou have years of experience with the following technologies:Strong programming and debugging skills in C# .NET with 4+ years experience.Strong knowledge of Windows Services and business applications with 4+ years experience.Strong knowledge of Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, SQS, RDS).Strong knowledge of OS, distributed systems and databases (NoSQL or relational).Strong programming and debugging skills in Python or PHP.

Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement.

Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here.

7558,"Software Developer","NZ, N, Wellington","","","Who is Powershop?We operate in an industry dominated by crusty utilities operating at glacial pace and with a fetish for technical jargon and industry complexity. So we created a business with a plan to change the world. Well, a small part of the world anyway. To establish a new electricity retailing business centered around continuous customer orientated innovation. Our strong belief is that disruptive change is the only way this can be achieved.So...we built a shop. A shop where customers can buy power. Simply a Powershop – no less, no more. Well, actually we are a whole lot more! In creating a shop, our aim is to change customer attitudes, and behaviors around electricity use and purchase. We aim to create a new breed of electricity consumer – an engaged consumer – one that is aware, informed and responsive. A consumer that finally knows what they are buying. A consumer that is truly in control of their power.What does Powershop stand for?So what lights our fire?First and foremost we stand for the customer. Yeah, whatever? Heard it all before. No really, we stand for the customer. We provide a shop, and focus on delivering customers excellent service, and enhancing and extending our services to deliver on ever changing customer needs and wants. That said, our focus is on delivering to contemporary shoppers – who value flexibility and choice – through contemporary shopping channels.We also thrive on transparency. This is the pre-requisite to delivering on our commitment to put customers in control of their power. It is also pre-requisite to establishing our credibility and indeed ensuring we are also appropriately disciplined in delivering on customer needs and wants.Finally, simplicity is a must. If buying electricity is not as simple as buying milk we have failed. ","Powershop might look like an electricity retailer, but it’s really a tech company in disguise: its entire operations are run by our in-house software.  We’re looking for more passionate developers to join us, working on our codebase alongside our incredibly good team of devs.We use Ruby on Rails.  Don’t know it yet?  We’ll happily train you in Rails as part of your job.  Ruby is a beautiful language; we guarantee you’ll love working with it.Here’s why you want to work here:We’ve got a relaxed environment with music, pool table, table tennis, decent coffee, beer and fruit.We’re serious about agile; it’s not a buzzword.  We do scrum, small integrated dev/design/test teams, peer code reviews and unit/integration tests because they all make for better software.Use whatever platform you like.  Whatever editor you want.  Do TDD?  Great.  Hate it?  Fine.  Peer programming?  If you like.  Work how you like working.The people here are seriously smart and open to new ideas.  We don’t have any dead wood.It’s a stable job in a growing company that refuses to be enterprisey.There’s something for devs of all skill levels to sink their teeth into.You'll spend 10% of your time on your own projects that don't need to relate to our business.Go sit with the CEO if you like; he works 15 metres from your desk.  We have a tight relationship between devs and the people we do work for.We know good developers are valuable and in demand, so we pay very well.A bit about PowershopWe're the world’s first online shop for electricity.  We've worked hard to turn the industry on its head and have built a company that people don't just like but actually love.  You don't get to remake electricity retailing from the ground up by employing cynics or clock-watchers.  We look for people who give a shit about what they do.Want to know more?Email us at #EMAIL_28c4a4042987ff7b720a2934fd8fcdae4849162973a68acf85598a8eb2e7d83c# and tell us about what makes you excited about your work.  Seriously, this is not just some feel-good marketing spiel: we really want to know.  We’ll send you a position description and get you on track.We’re happy to consider you even if you can't yet work in New Zealand.","","",0,1,0,"Full-time","","","Computer Software","Information Technology",0

Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees.

Sometimes we sleep in the office. Sometimes we chat with clients at 3am. Sometimes we don't sleep at all. We work on weekends. We're hustlers and thrive on the craziness. But, we all have balanced lives outside of work and prioritize those things that are important to us. Family, friends, nights out, music, and the abundant nature that exists outside of our beautiful city - we play just as hard as we work.Defend or DieAt GoRefi, we're insanely passionate about fixing our broken industry. Transparency with our clients is paramount so it's only natural that our work environment embody the same openness. With so many ideas and only so much bandwidth to execute, open communication is key. We're small, lean, and nimble so your opinion is expected and respected. But, when you present an idea, be ready to defend it - because we question everything. It's this type of collaboration that helps us decide what to focus our energies on next.Strive for PerfectionWe fail every day, and it's awesome, because it means we're getting closer. There's a push to get our features out there and it's often a sacrifice to hit those deadlines, but given the sensitive nature of what GoRefi does, putting features out just for the sake of putting features out doesn't fly. We prefer to take a bit of extra time to do it right, even though we're moving at light speed compared to our competitors.Don't be a ""Larry""No offense if your name is Larry, of course. In this example, Larry's the typical used-car salesman selling you rust protection when you live in California or the fly-by-night mortgage broker charging you exorbitant fees and putting you in the wrong loan. This lie-cheat-steal crap is all over the web and in case you couldn't tell already - we're sick of it. A Larry is enticed by quotas - not service - and is compensated without justification of hours worked or exceptional performance. They sell for themselves and for their wallet, with a short-term vision that hurts everyone in their lives, especially their customers. At GoRefi, we don't have a Sales Department - we only have Support. Our clients get what's best for them and only them. Our motive is and always will be to ensure that our clients are happy with their experience.","Full-Stack Software Engineer - San Francisco/Fairfax, CA#URL_4b8a8c7911c73321dea3236076d03c7a75f783e4b6fd81447c55fc17976370d8#GoRefi is building a platform for automating the front-end mortgage origination process, an annual $1.8T vertical that ultimately touches the lives of over 70 million Americans.

13618,"Sales Development Representative","US, CA, San Francisco","","","","A Unique Job With a Great Company Do you want an exciting job you love, working with other superstars? Are you excited by making a real difference for customers? Join us as our Sales Development Representative! We’re a unique and innovative marketing technology &amp; services company… And we’re growing! Our new Sales Development Representative position is a key role in our company, because you’ll be the first person our prospects speak to. You, and your efforts, will have a real impact on the company finding, partnering with, and retaining great customers.  What Do We Do? Our company has offers sophisticated “done for you” marketing technology and services to solo practitioner lawyers and boutique law firms. You see, all lawyers (and especially lawyers in small practices) have a problem – and that’s there are only so many hours in the day. And each hour they’re working on their client work, they’re not marketing their practice – which means fewer clients tomorrow. And if they’re spending time marketing their practice, they’re not doing the client work that makes them money. On top of that, they still have to keep running an office and handling all the administration that goes along with it. So they’re always juggling between “doing the work” and “getting the work” … which keeps their businesses stuck in a rut. BUT – if they can break free of that tension, they can really grow their firms. How do they do that? That’s where our company comes in – handling their marketing for them. We’ve created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from. We take that a step further and provide it as a ‘done for you’ system so that our customers don’t need to manage our systems. We manage it for them, so they can get back to practicing law. Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with – and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need. Our company is a profitable start-up, but it’s not like other Bay Area startups you might read about. We're small but we have a service with proven demand, great customers, and room for you to make a meaningful contribution both to our customers’ businesses and our team. We’re also not the sleep under your desk, constant chaos kind of place. We have a vision and a strategy for where we are going, and a clear path to get there. We’re looking for someone who is motivated by our vision, and by helping our customers succeed.  What Will You Do? As a Sales Development Representative, you will review in-bound requests for information from prospective customers, and reach out to understand more about their businesses. You'll connect them with the resources they need. For prospects who are the right fit for our services, you'll connect them with our strategy team to see whether or not we can help them. If they're not the right fit for our services, you'll still help them by directing them to other resources. You see, this isn't just another ""sales role"". We are absolutely committed to adding value to every potential customer we interact with, whether or not we're the ones for them. And what that means is, this isn't the job for everyone-  This is the right job for you if you: ... Truly want to help customers find the right solution to better their lives and their business ... Are unflappably excited and positive (even if a prospect doesn't want the help you're offering them) ... Like being given clear guidance on benchmarks to hit ... Are sharp as a tack - and like working with other superstars ... Take pride in going the extra mile ... Like pitching in for the team ... Are always looking to improve your craft - how to present better, how to position better, how to sell better ... Are looking for a workplace to call 'home' for the long termOur Process Is Different We offer an extraordinary opportunity with a top-notch team. We'd rather not hire, than hire the wrong person. Because of that our hiring process is different. This isn't going to be sending in a resume, and a series of resume-reading meetings. So, expect that this process will take longer... But as a result, you'll know this is the place for you. We're in it for the long haul, and want the right people on the team.This position is full-time in our offices in downtown San Francisco.
