# Fake-Job-Prediction
 
In this project, the objective is to create an effective binary classification model to identify fraudulent job posts. The training set of job posts consists of 6362 rows, 16 features, one unique identifier column, and one classifier of fraudulent/legitimate. 

- Feature Engineering is one of the most important part of the project, in which most of the work is related to text process.
- A total of 3 models are used conduct the prediction: Random Forest, SVM and Gradient Boosting. 
- The best performed model reached 0.6875 sensitivity, 0.9989 specificity, and 0.9838 overall accuracy.
