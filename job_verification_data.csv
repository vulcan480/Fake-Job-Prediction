Projects are varied, but include M&amp;A due diligence, decision support, and growth strategy.??Our pool of talent is comprised of independent professionals with a consulting toolkit. Most of our professionals have degrees from Top 10 business schools and experience in consulting at top firms and/or proven impact in corporate management positions.These professionals are independent not by default but by design. Personal or family constraints may prevent them from working the seemingly standard 60+ hour work-week, but they are committed to intellectual engagement and driving client success. Talent Response works with firms whose business models can support remote collaboration, allowing professionals to balance work and family obligations.","Project-based Management ConsultantTalent Response works to connect independent professionals like yourself that have had it with the 70-hour, 70%-travel work-week with boutique consulting firms trying to better manage variable project demand.??We are trusted advisers to boutique consulting firms, sourcing the most qualified consultants to augment staff on projects such as M&amp;A due diligence, go-to-market strategy, and litigation support.??Unlike consulting job boards, we present only qualified opportunities to you, dramatically reducing your search costs (e.g. marketing, sales) for consulting engagements. Consulting firms call us when the need for qualified professionals is most pressing, resulting in a fast matching process.If you're interested in becoming a part of the Talent Response network, please submit your resume??- it??should take around 2 minutes by pulling from your LinkedIn profile.

After the drought of work, with time often spent drafting unsolicited proposals, the big jobs would finally come in. Like other boutique consulting firms, the firm would struggle to staff up on projects that came in waves. The??true cost of??this unpredictable??project demand??extended beyond the cost of lower overall utilization to include costs of employee turnover, layoffs, and deferred project work.On the other side of the equation, post-MBA independent consultants have precisely the skills required to deliver on those ?€?peak demand?€? engagements. Increasingly, professionals are rejecting the trade-off between the 70-hour work week and exiting the workforce. Instead, they are utilizing their skills in a way that gives them a bit more control over the nature and intensity of the projects they take on.Why shouldn't there be a way to meet project surges at consulting firms with independent consultants carrying a management consulting toolkit? Why can?€?t we better balance the two sides of this equation?Our answer to that question is Talent Response. Built through partnerships with MBA alumni associations and elite consulting firms, the Talent Response network is comprised of candidates specifically recruited to meet the needs of elite consulting firms. These individuals are??independent by design, not by default. Over 80% of our network has earned MBAs from Top 15 schools, and the majority has experience managing project teams at Big Three and boutique consulting firms.Consulting firms that adopt this approach experience a steadier workload for full-time staff, lower attrition, and fewer lost or deferred projects. ??The domain expertise of our professionals can also be leveraged to??extend into adjacent practice??areas.

2561,Field Operations Specialist,"US, ND, Grand Forks",,,"Working at FBNAt FBN, we put farmers first. For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small. Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it?€?s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone?€?s right to at least one day a week without meetings.

Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.","Farmers Business Network (?€?FBN?€?) is an advanced information and decision support system serving farmers and their trusted advisors.

Peter Thiel and Khosla Ventures.Ours is a uniquely collaborative environment that fuses engineering, law, product and design. Building an ontology of the law requires a deep understanding of natural and legal language. We leverage advanced language technologies and legal experience to organize the law in ways previously only dreamed of.","Judicata is looking for an Office Manager.I?€?m not referring to an administrator or office coordinator or even an executive assistant. Admins can work plug-&amp;-play in nearly any environment, helping a team or department with simple administrative tasks. Their skills are real, their role is necessary, and I?€?m sure many of them excel at their jobs. ??And we don?€?t need one of them. An Office Manager, on the other hand, takes responsibility for facilitating all the operations of an office. They will be a central hub that is essential to our success. Their job, in effect, is to work often independently and in the??background?€?identifying??problems, considering all contributing factors, and executing effective solutions as quickly as possible.That may not seem like a huge distinction, but maybe it?€?s easier to illustrate the differences not in terms of what you do as an Office Manager, but what you gain from being one:As an Office Manager you will learn (and hopefully help form) the inner workings of a company. Startups around here are known for openness, transparency and flat hierarchies, but most employees will never actually engage with the organizational machinery that drives the success of the company. You will live in it. As an Office Manager, you join the Operations department, tasked with understanding the ways in which we work, supporting our colleagues when possible, and improving our work processes.As an Office Manager you will contribute directly to the creation of an incredible product. We?€?re tackling big problems here, and to achieve our ambitious goals we?€?ve recruited exceptional talent in engineering and law and have enlisted the support and guidance from some notable investors. The candidate we hire for this position will be a highly valued member of our small team; they will see the effects of their contributions in real-time; and they will feel crucial because we very much need them right now.As an Office Manager you can jumpstart your career. This seems like an unlikely path to success, but I speak from experience when I say that it is a lesser-known road. I cut my professional teeth as an Office Manager in the early days at Box, and the skills I gained there have propelled me in my career. Working in Operations, especially in the beginning stages of a startup, grants access to every area of the business?€?administration, finance, human resources, recruiting, business development, marketing and sales, support, organizational development, strategy, et cetera. For the right individual who is eager to work, learn, and grow in their career, immersing daily in this myriad of areas provides a rare experience and invaluable education in how to successfully run a business. As a former Office Manager, I have become an organizational jack-of-all-trades and have come to realize that there is significant value in knowing how to get things done in a variety of areas.It?€?s impossible to articulate just what all we need from you, but here is a general list of responsibilities that begins to scratch the surface:Oversee all daily aspects of office facilitiesWelcome and receive guestsManage lunch/dinner orderingManage all grocery ordering/shoppingManage all supply orderingHandle all postage and shipping (inbound and outbound)Oversee building management (e.g., repairs, cleaning, improvements, relocation, etc)Organize and maintain a clean and professional physical space in the officePlan and manage social life for the companye.g., Happy Hours, quarterly off-site events, holiday parties, etcManage company calendar onlineCoordinate guest visits, usability testing, etc.Support executive teamPlan, coordinate, and manage special projects; Possible examples include:RecruitingDesigning accounting processesFundraisingConference/event planningCommunity engagement (e.g., blog, social networking, etc)_______________________________________________________________________________________________________If you?€?re up for all of this, then we hope you apply below.
